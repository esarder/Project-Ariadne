Hello, Rhett

You were selected by Bailey as an emergency contact for their Project Ariadne
profile. For their safety, Bailey set up a timer, which in the event that they
did not declare themselves safe after CrazyRichAsians, would notify you.

Bailey has not checked in and could need assistance. Please reach out to
Bailey immediately.

In the event of an emergency, contact your local police department by dialing
911.
